                    <div>The Honourable Finance Minister in his budget speech (para 49) for 2006-07 announced that the
                        Government had decided to ensure that farmers receive short term credit at 7% with an upper
                        limit of Rs. 3.00 lakh on the principal amount. The policy came into force with effect from
                        Kharif 2006-07. The amount of subvention was to be calculated on the amount of crop loan from
                        the date of disbursement up to the actual date of repayment of the crop loan by the farmer or up
                        to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum
                        period of one year.</div>

                    <div>In pursuance of this announcement, the Government of India provided interest subvention of 2%
                        to Public Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Cooperative Banks in respect of short
                        term production credit up to Rs. 3.00 lakh provided to farmers out of their own resources,
                        provided that they make available short term credit @ 7% p.a. at ground level. Private Sector
                        Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi urban branches) are also covered under
                        the scheme from the year 2013-14 with similar terms and conditions.</div>
